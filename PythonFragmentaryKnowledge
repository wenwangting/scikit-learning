1 function zip
    Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the i-th element
  from each of the argument sequences.  The returned list is truncated
  in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.
  x = [1, 2, 3]
  y = [4, 5, 6]
  z = [7, 8, 9]
  res = zip(x, y, z)
  [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]
  
2 enumerrate
  count a file lines. 
  count = len(open("./SVMs.py", 'rU').readlines())
  This method is easy but may not work while the file is too great.
  We an use enumerrate:
  for count, line in enumerate(open('./SVMs.py', 'rU')):
    pass
  count += 1
  for enumerrate iteratively retrieves the list or file.
